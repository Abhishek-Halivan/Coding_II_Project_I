# Coding_II_Project_I
Task:
Develop a little game, simulation, or interactive animation in Processing.

It should contain at least 3 classes (e.g. a Paddle, a Ball, and some Bricks, or a Spaceship, a Cannon, and some Meteorites, or ...).

The game should include at least two of the following topics:

Arrays
Transformation
Image Manipulation
Process/Progress Documentation:
Present and discuss intermediate results, questions, obstacles that you encountered, or just fun stuff that happened while working on the project at least every second day during the project phase to continuously document the progress of your work on Yellowdig. Tag your posts with the project name (Project 1) and the Team Name. I expect all team members to contribute to this process documentation. Do not just double-post what your team mate already has posted. Rather contribute your perspective as a comment to your team mates post. Of course, everybody is welcome to give feedback to each of the teams. not just your own. Thumbs up, smileys, etc. are fine, but it shhouldn't stop there; I expect a bit more interaction. These posts are documenting your team processes. If you are not working on the task continuously, but rather bundle the workload on a single day, then keep posting your process during that day. In the end, I expect at least 7 posts or comments per team member, that document the continous process and progress of your work. E.g. screenshots of intermediate states, screencasts, error messages etc.

Deadline and Deliverables:
Submission deadline is at the end of Week 3.
Please, upload a zip-file containing 
your Processing sketch,
a PDF that describes the project and serves as a manual how to use the application,
and a learning log containing your intermediate posts on Yellowdig. 
the link to your github repository.
Expected Workload:
In total, the expected workload for this project is around five to six hours. Although the deadline for the project is at the end of Week 3, the time to work on this project is budgeted fully in Week 2.

AI Usage:
You can use AI tools to support you with the task. But you'll have to follow a couple of rules.

Don't prompt something that just solves the task for you. 
Provide sample prompts that you've been using.
Don't use merely decorative illustrations. All visualizations should serve a purpose. Some AI tools tend to produce such images.
Use this Framework to indicate how you employed AI and for which purposes. Clearly state what you did.
Lots of success!
